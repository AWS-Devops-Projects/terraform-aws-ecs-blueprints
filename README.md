# Amazon ECS Blueprints for Terraform

Welcome to Amazon ECS Blueprints for Terraform!

This repository contains a collection of Terraform modules that aim to make it easier and faster for customers to adopt [Amazon ECS and Fargate](https://aws.amazon.com/ecs/). It can be used by AWS customers, partners, and internal AWS teams to provision a number of architectural `blueprints` using ECS and Fargate.


## Getting Started

Start with the architectural blueprint that most closely matches your use case.  The following is a list of supported blueprints:

- [Load Balanced Web Service](./blueprints/load-balanced-web-service/README.md) (coming soon)
- [Two Tier DynamoDB App](./blueprints/two-tier-dynamodb-app/)
